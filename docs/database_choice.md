| Feature                   | SQL (Relational)                                      | NoSQL (Non-relational)                                | Why NoSQL (MongoDB) for AI QA Service                 |
|---------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------|
| **Schema**                | Predefined schemas                   | Schema-less, flexible                                 | Allows for flexible and evolving data models         |
| **Scalability**           | Vertical scaling(Horizaontal scaling is cumbersome)                                    | Horizontal scaling, easy to distribute data           | Handles large volumes of data and high traffic       |
| **Performance**           | Higher read/write throughput | Optimized for high read/write throughput              | Provides high read/write throughput |
| **Complex Queries**       | Supports complex join (FK)              | Limited support for complex joins                     | Simple relationships, no need for complex joins      |
| **Data Integrity**        | Strong data integrity with ACID properties           | Eventual consistency, flexible transactions           | Sufficient for application's needs                   |
